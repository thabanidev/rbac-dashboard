## **Assignment: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**

### **Objective**

To evaluate your creativity, understanding, and technical skills in building a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** User Interface. This assignment is designed to give you the flexibility to showcase your problem-solving abilities and your personal approach to designing secure and functional UIs.

> Note:
> 
> 
> If you have already implemented an RBAC UI in any project, you can submit that project for evaluation. Be sure to include a detailed description and links to the repository or deployment.
> 

### **Key Instructions**

- **You don’t have to follow any specific structure.**
    
    You are free to design the UI, features, and models as you see fit, based on your understanding of an ideal RBAC system.
    
- **Creativity is encouraged.**
    
    Feel free to innovate and add features or designs that you think would enhance the functionality or user experience.
    

### **Flexibility**

You have full freedom to:

- Choose any frontend framework or library (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
- Implement any UI design approach you prefer (table views, modals, inline editing, etc.).
- Define the data models, UI components, and workflows as per your understanding.

---

### **Scenario**

Imagine you are tasked with building an admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions. The goal is to design a secure and user-friendly interface where administrators can assign roles, define permissions, and manage users efficiently.

### **Core Requirements**

1. **User Management:**
    - Provide a way to view and manage users.
    - Include options to add, edit, or delete users.
    - Enable assigning roles to users and managing their status (e.g., Active/Inactive).
2. **Role Management:**
    - Create a way to define and edit roles.
    - Allow roles to include permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.
3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
    - Design a method to assign or modify permissions for roles.
    - Display permissions clearly for ease of understanding and modification.
4. **Custom API Simulation (Optional):**
    - Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
    - Simulate server responses to validate functionality.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Creativity and Design Quality:**
    
    The visual appeal, layout, and innovative elements in the design. How well the UI aligns with the RBAC theme and the creative enhancements implemented.
    
2. **Responsiveness:**
    
    How effectively the UI adapts to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.
    
3. **Functionality:**
    
    Implementation of core RBAC features, such as user and role management, permissions handling, and CRUD operations.
    
4. **User Experience (UX):**
    
    The intuitiveness, accessibility, and fluidity of interactions within the UI, ensuring ease of use for administrators.
    
5. **Technical Skill:**
    
    The quality of code, modularity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Consideration of client-side security and efficient use of resources.
    
6. **Documentation:**
    
    Clarity and detail in the README file, including setup instructions, project overview, and explanation of features.
    
7. **Security Practices:**
